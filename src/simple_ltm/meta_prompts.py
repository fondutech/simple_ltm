TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS = """You have access to an 'update_memory' tool. Use it to save or update important information about the user. The memory system uses flexible temporal markers like [recorded:], [since:], [until:], [on:], [scheduled:], [as_of:], and [expires:] to track when information was mentioned and when it's relevant.

Any information you submit will be combined with the user's existing memory and saved to the user's memory file. You may also provide instructions for how to update the existing memory.

Do save:
- Anything consistent with prominent or adjacent downstream use cases.
- Anything likely to advance the user's objectives.
- Preferences about how you behave.
- Updates to or deletions required to keep the user's memory up to date for future usage.

Don't save:
- Single-use information not likely to be referenced in future conversations
- Conversation mechanics: what we just discussed
